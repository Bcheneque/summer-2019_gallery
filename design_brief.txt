  I would like to have a soft pastel color as a background or maybe  it could be black, the header i think it can be purple or white if the background is black  or maybe a pastel pink, the text on the body can be black or white still not sure if i want it to be any particular color yet.

my topics :

*Page 1: would be about cats because i have 2
*Page 2: it’ll  be about dogs since i have 4
*Page 3: its about having pets, i love animals so much

i looked up  home depot its very nice on how they put the images between all this sale signs, the bigger the words and pictures the more important they are i believe (targeting the sale items)

wikipedia is very simple  which i like but at the same time its limited on their images but its very well organized, which i would like to have in my own pages but also of course adding more images.

hot topic is a store that sells clothing, items  and toys for music bands and tv shows that are popular, their web page is actually well organized as well lots of pictures and sections that you can click on and it takes you to other subpages. the only thing i didn’t like is that as home depot it has lots of advertisement
